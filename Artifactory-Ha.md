##### Architecture of Artifactory HA

![HA Artifactory Architecture](images/HA_Diagram.png)

## To Set Up Artifactory HA in DCOS following are prerequisites:
1. **NFS Storage**
2. **Database (MySQL, Oracle,  MS SQL and PostgreSQL)**
3. **Artifactory Pro Enterprise Value Pack**

## It requires min 1 Public Slave to install Artifactory Pro or Enterprise

## Steps to Set Up Artifactory HA:

1. Mount NFS Storage to Each Private Node of DC/OS Cluster.<br />
    For example: You have artifactoryha.mount.com:/artifactory as your mount point.
    Mount it to /var/data/artha dir of your each private node of DC/OS.<br />
    ```sudo mount artifactoryha.mount.com:/artifactory /var/artifactory/```<br />
    All the nodes should share the same file storage, for now the only way is to use NFS. This requirement will be removed in the future.<br />
    Note: Provide permission to write and create subdirectories to /var/data/artha.
    
2. Install MySQL in DC/OS.<br />
    [Here is guide to install MySQL in DC/OS](install-mysql.md)
    The database is used by all the nodes to store metadata attached to artifacts.<br />
